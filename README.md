# HTML to Char
Convert HTML files to Char variable with ease.

## Why ?
I really don't know, i was trying to make a webserver for a project with NodeMCU and i realized that i have to convert every line by hand so i made this.

## Example

## How to Use ?
Easy, you can open it with cmd, python.. anything you want but if you want to convert a file that isn't "index.html" you can use arguments before starting.

| Argument      | Description |
| ----------- | -----------             |
| -h          | Shows all commands      |
| -f          | Name of the input file  |
| -o          | Name of the output file |
